# ðŸ‘‹ Hello, I'm AldairnunezCA!

Welcome to my corner of the internet! I'm a passionate developer with a love for animated movies *specially stop-motion* and video games. When I'm not writing code, you can find enjoying a nice videogame, watching a movie, or probably just scrolling through my phone*.

## ðŸš€ Tech Stack
I work with a variety of technologies, and I'm always excited to learn more. Here are the tools I frequently use:

### Frontend:
- **HTML** & **CSS** for structure and style
- **JavaScript** for interactive features
- **React.js** for building dynamic user interfaces
- **Bootstrap** for responsive design

### Backend:
- **Node.js** & **Express** for server-side development
- **NestJS** for scalable and maintainable backend apps
- **TypeScript** for enhanced JavaScript functionality and better code quality

### Database:
- **SQL** & **PostgreSQL** for structured data management

### Cloud & Storage:
- **Cloudinary** for managing and optimizing images and media files

### Design & Collaboration:
- **Figma** for creating UI/UX designs and collaborating on visual elements
- **Git** for version control and collaboration on projects

## ðŸŒŸ Interests & Hobbies
- ðŸŽ¬ **Animated Movies**: I'm a huge fan of well-crafted animation, whether it's from big studios like Pixar or smaller indie films.
- ðŸŽ® **Video Games**: I enjoy exploring any games that offer great storytelling, unique mechanics, and challenging gameplay. Or at least a cute character. ðŸ¤—

## ðŸ’» Current Projects
Iâ€™m currently working on:
- A **full-stack proyect** to help fitness users track their workout, purchase wellbeing products, or get in touch with gyms close to their location.
